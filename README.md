⭐️: **Yolo weights has been updated, try the new version watermark detect model, it should work better.**


## 1. Method

The SoraWatermarkCleaner(we call it `SoraWm` later) is composed of two parsts:

- SoraWaterMarkDetector: We trained a yolov11s version to detect the sora watermark. (Thank you yolo!)

- WaterMarkCleaner: We refer iopaint's implementation for watermark removal using the lama model.

  (This codebase is from https://github.com/Sanster/IOPaint#, thanks for their amazing work!)

Our SoraWm is purely deeplearning driven and yields good results in many generated videos.



## 2. Installation

[FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) is needed for video processing, please install it first.  We highly recommend using the `uv` to install the environments:

1. installation:

```bash
uv sync
```

> now the envs will be installed at the `.ven`, you can activate the env using:
>
> ```bash
> source .venv/bin/activate
> ```

2. Downloaded the pretrained models:

The trained yolo weights will be stored in the `resources` dir as the `best.pt`.  And it will be automatically download from https://github.com/linkedlist771/SoraWatermarkCleaner/releases/download/V0.0.1/best.pt . The `Lama` model is downloaded from https://github.com/Sanster/models/releases/download/add_big_lama/big-lama.pt, and will be stored in the torch cache dir. Both downloads are automatic, if you fail, please check your internet status.

## 3.  Demo

To have a basic usage, just try the `example.py`:

```python

from pathlib import Path
from sorawm.core import SoraWM


if __name__ == "__main__":
    input_video_path = Path(
        "resources/dog_vs_sam.mp4"
    )
    output_video_path = Path("outputs/sora_watermark_removed.mp4")
    sora_wm = SoraWM()
    sora_wm.run(input_video_path, output_video_path)

```

We also provide you with a `streamlit` based interactive web page, try it with:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

<img src="resources/app.png" style="zoom: 25%;" />

## **4. WebServer**

Here, we provide a **FastAPI-based web server** that can quickly turn this watermark remover into a service.

Simply run:

```
python start_server.py
```

The web server will start on port **5344**.

You can view the FastAPI [documentation](http://localhost:5344/docs) for more details.

There are three routes available:

1. **submit_remove_task**

   > After uploading a video, a task ID will be returned, and the video will begin processing immediately.

2. **get_results**

You can use the task ID obtained above to check the task status.

It will display the percentage of video processing completed.

Once finished, the returned data will include a **download URL**.

3. **download**

You can use the **download URL** from step 2 to retrieve the cleaned video.
